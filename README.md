This launcher was created to help those who want to easily switch between WoW Legion and WoW Vanilla graphics.  Maybe you want to use the legion graphics to make the game look much prettier, but use vanilla when raiding for increased performance.  The legion files do have some quirkyness to them, one notable being gnolls now have horn without a texture.  There are some other small issues but this script will make it easy to switch between the two versions.

Requirements:

Place the launcher inside inside the wow folder that has wow.exe.
You may want to create a shortcut to the launcher by right clicking it and creating a shortcut on your desktop.

You need the Legion graphics files from here

These files need to go into your WoW folder inside of the data folder with the other patches

Optional:

If you would like to get additional FPS and other fixes download to the client to enable option 3 and 4, download Vanillafixes.exe 
This file WILL trigger your antivrius because it injects a DLL into the wow.exe client, but is 100% safe.  You just need to whitelist it.

Additionally if is HIGHLY recommended that you patch your wow.exe to fix stuttering and enable automatic looting when you open a corpse as well as other fixes such as widescreen support.
